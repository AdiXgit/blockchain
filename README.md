# Blockchain and P2P Network

This project implements a simple blockchain and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network for communication between nodes. The blockchain is used to store transactions, and the P2P network allows nodes to communicate and share blockchain data.

## Features

- **Blockchain**: A simple blockchain implementation with support for adding transactions and validating the chain.
- **P2P Network**: A peer-to-peer network that allows nodes to connect, communicate, and share blockchain data.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Custom implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for block hashing.
